  <h1>e-Portfolio</h1>
  <p>e-Portfolio was built as a part of Bristol University's Software Project
    Engineering module, a year long effort which focused on the principles of
    group based software development. Our client, a lecturer at The University
    of
    Bristol, wished for a site where users could document their achievements
    from
    their time in university in more depth than would be allowed in a CV.
