  <h1>The Practice of Programming</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <i>"With the same insight and authority that made their book The Unix
      Programming Environment a classic, Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike have
      written
      The Practice of Programming to help make individual programmers more
      effective and productive.
      <br>
      <br>
      The practice of programming is more than just writing code. Programmers
      must
      also assess trade-offs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test,
      improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves and
      others.
      At the same time, they must be concerned with issues like compatibility,
      robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications."

  <p>I am enjoying working my way through <i>The Practice of Programming</i>,
    and after a year filled with software engineering at university and in
    internships it is both reassuring to see my most used programming patterns
    backed up by well respected programmers, and to learn new patterns for
    designing well structured software.</p>
  <p>I wish to document my progress throughout the text by frequently uploading
    answers to the solutions for each chapter, which should act as a form of
    self discipline to prevent me from getting discouraged if and when the
    content increases in complexity.</p>
