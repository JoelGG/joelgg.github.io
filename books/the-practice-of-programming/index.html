  <h1>The Practice of Programming</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <i>"With the same insight and authority that made their book The Unix
      Programming Environment a classic, Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike have
      written
      The Practice of Programming to help make individual programmers more
      effective and productive.
      <br>
      <br>
      The practice of programming is more than just writing code. Programmers
      must
      also assess trade-offs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test,
      improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves and
      others.
      At the same time, they must be concerned with issues like compatibility,
      robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications."
