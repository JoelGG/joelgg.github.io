    <h2>My Experience at Byrd</h2>
    <p align=”justify”>I worked at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210505234916/http://www.byrd.run/">Byrd</a>
      for three months
      during the summer of 2020 and for a month in the summer of 2021. I gained the role by applying through the
      University of Bristol's Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) internship scheme in 2020. The role was initially
      intended to last for only a month however the team were so impressed with my performance that I was asked to
      return for the next two months. I would have liked to have worked for the same amount of time in 2021 however I
      was about to begin my year abroad at the University of Copenhagen so I was only able to work for a month.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Summer 2020</h3>
    My work during the summer of 2020 mostly consisted of front-end development for the Byrd mobile app. The team was
    approaching the completion of the MVC (Minimum Viable Product) and so I was tasked with implementing and improving
    many missing views, such as screens dedicated to a user's goals, the entire settings panel, and views for an
    individual run.
    <h4>Map Screen</h4>
    <p>
      I implemented a map screen for the app using the OpenStreetMap Flutter plugin. This was developed as a component
      included in a view which gave an overview of a user's run which included metrics such as distance travelled and
      average pace. In order to maintain the design language for the app I implemented a custom theme for the map,
      and I added markers for the user's start and end positions. I used coordinate data to draw the user's run route
      using location coordinates recorded during the run. Different run providers, such as Strava and Garmin, use
      different coordinate systems and tracking algorithms so I had to implement a method to convert between these
      different systems to ensure that the run route was drawn correctly. The map included functions to centre the
      screen around the path taken by the user and to zoom in and out of to an acceptable degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial choice was to use the MapBox api to implement the map screen however the API was less mature than the
      OpenStreetMap plugin and was not as well documented. The OpenStreetMap plugin was also open source and therefore
      free to use, which was a key consideration for a startup company. The OpenStreetMap plugin was also more
      performant as it used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map">tiled web map</a> system rather than
      the vector maps used by Mapbox GL. I went over the advantages and disadvantges of both providers with the team
      and we decided that the OpenStreetMap plugin was the best choice for the app.
    </p>
    <h4>Run Goals</h4>
    <p>
      I implemented a view for a user's running goal. A goal would consist of a distance (e.g. 5k, 10k, half-marathon)
      and a target pace. The goal view would display the user's progress towards their goal and would display a set of
      potential times based on different paces which were taken from the user's previous runs. The goal view produced a
      kilometer by kilometer breakdown of potential pace for a goal to be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a view required a variety of components such as sliders, table views, custom icons, and more. The view
      faithfully implemented the specification provided by the designer and was well received by the team.
    </p>
    <h4>Settings Panel and User Onboarding</h4>
    <p>
      I implemented a settings panel for the app which allowed the user to change a number of parameters including
      personal information, distance metrics, and more. The settings panel was implemented as a series of views which
      all shared a common design language and common custom components. Many of these views, such as preferred distance
      metrics and location information were shared with the user onboarding flow, which I also helped to implement. Such
      work requied building on componants built by other developers and required a good understanding of the codebase.
      It also requied an awareness of where the components and views were currently used and how they could be extended
      without changing their behaviour in other parts of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst many of the views were simple forms others were more complex. For example, the view which allowed the user
      to delete their account requied to user to enter their password and then confirm their decision to delete their
      account. Sensetive pages such as these required interaction with the Firebase backend, which I also implemented.
    </p>
    <h3>Summer 2021</h3>
    <p>
      Despite only having a month to work at Byrd in 2021 I was able to make some important contributions to the app.
      I'm proud of the experiential achievements feature, which added a human touch to the feedback and made each run a
      bit
      more memorable. I also implemented a test suite for the app which allowed the team to test the app more
      thoroughly. I enjoyed working on aspects of the project that I could take near full ownership of and which had a
      tangible
      impact on either the user experience or that of the rest of the development team.
    </p>
    <h4>Experiental Goals</h4>
    <p>
      The team had been wanting to add a feature that allowed completed runs to have more context than just statistics,
      and we hatched the idea for an experiental goals system that would hilight a range of different achievements that
      a user had completed in a given run. These ranged from performance milestones such as best pace or longest
      distance to more fun achievements such as running at goldel hour or running during a full moon. The idea was to
      give users the sense that each run could provide unique experiences and provide a reward mechanism where the user
      could discover new achievements and try to complete them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed taking this feature from conception to implementation. I worked with the rest of the team to come up
      with where are how this would be visualised in the app, and which computation would take place on the server and
      which
      would take place locally. Implementing the feature involved analysing large quantities of data from the Firebase
      Cloud Firestore database through the use of Firebase Cloud Functions. I also had to implement a system where this
      data could be effectively communicated to the client app. The client app would call a function on the server to
      check whether the goals
      had been completed and then would display the goals in a view. I implemented a custom view for the goals which
      was designed to be reusable and to be easily extended to include new goals.
    </p>
    <h4>Test Suite</h4>
    <p>
      For the remainder of my time working at Byrd in the summer of 2021 I worked on implementing a test suite for the
      app. The app was already being tested manually by the team however this was time consuming and did not provide the
      kind of guranteed
      coverage that a test suite would provide. I implemented a test suite using the Flutter test framework which
      allowed the team to test the app more thoroughly and to test the app more quickly. Tests ranged from UI level
      component tests to unit tests for the app's business logic. It was really rewarding to work on this side of the
      app,
      as even though it was not visible to the user it made the app more reliable, improving user experience, and
      improved the experience of my colleages even when I had left to return to my studies.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>
      I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Byrd and felt that it was a great opportunity to work in a small team on
      a product that I was passionate about. I was able to make a real impact on the app and I was able to take
      ownership of a number of features. I found many of the skills I gained during my time at Byrd were helpful in
      other situations. Front-end programming in flutter shares many similarities with working with the React framework,
      and as such improving my ability to write declarative UI components and work with state management libraries
      helped down the line when working on React projects for university.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction to an AGILE workflow and a focus on good Git processes was incredibly useful. I was able to take
      this knowledge and apply it to my group projects at university, and I was able to help my group members to adopt
      to these processes.
